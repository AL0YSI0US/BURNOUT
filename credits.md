  Shoutout to [Microcosm Publishing](https://microcosmpublishing.com/) for amplifying neurodivergent authors and whose zines have literally saved my life.

  Mad Props to my dear friend and mentor [Morgan Vanderpool](https://twitter.com/MorganxMovement), I have a trmendous amount of gratitude for the ways we are able to navigate consent and hold eachother accountable in life, community and emotionally. Co-regulating with them is my jimmy-jam! [I have also dubbed them my translator, this witch does things with words I merely dream of, a genuine bridge buillder!]

> I have always found it negligent that most resources cite attatchment stuff as things that come soley from our childhoods. Our attatchment styles show up in every relationship romantic or not and change between partners and relationships/ dynamics and morph as we age, develop and mature.

  
 Gotta say a walloping thank you to [Kristina Flynn] Their energy alone challenges me to push my technologichal edges to create accessible content for the masses, ever mindful of my abiility to stimulation and my possible impact on my Neurodivergent community. I try my damndest to regualte myse;f, my content and be real about my struggles when Im in the company of others. I feel a sense of responsibility to model choices people may not otherwise be aware of.  
  
  
  Big thanks to Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D. [RIP]  His work with [Nonviolent Communication](https://classroommanagementcem.weebly.com/uploads/4/3/2/5/4325801/nvc_language_of_life_chapters_1-5.pdf) has influenced culture, especially in the social justice realm around consensual dialogue.
  
  Last but not least, Thank you to the [Aragon](https://twitter.com/AragonDao) community for the platform around mental health and for collaborating with [GravityDAO](https://twitter.com/GravityDAO)!
