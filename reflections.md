  ### [How to Make a Decision](https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/posters/8291) (vertical) by Joe Biel  
Life is full of major decisions and often we get lost and mired in the slog of figuring out what's best for us, <br>
  or worse, comparing ourselves to others.<br>
  This poster outlines how we make decisions at Microcosm, what goes into them and how to assess criteria for achieving <br>
  the results you desire rather than bumbling through the motions.

This poster is part of the continuing effort at Microcosm to create a lasting legacy of who we are and what we do so others can recreate our success from the bread crumbs we leave behind.

  ### [How to Thrive / How to Starve](https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/posters/8292) by Joe Biel  
Recently, an artist friend celebrated a modicum of success after five years of hard work. Many people cheered and celebrated but one person felt left out and lashed out in a jealous rage. Why weren't they celebrating a big success? They worked hard too. It's an easy trap to fall into and we've all done it.

Fortunately, the reality is that there is **enough pie to go around** if we don't react like it's a scarcity economy. Our feelings dictate not only how other people interpret our actions but the rewards and response that we receive. There is enough to go around if we realize it and act like it. Put this poster on your wall and start to thrive.
