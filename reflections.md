  ### [How to Make a Decision](https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/posters/8291) (vertical) by Joe Biel  
Life is full of major decisions and often we get lost and mired in the slog of figuring out what's best for us, <br>
  or worse, comparing ourselves to others.<br>
  This poster outlines how we make decisions at Microcosm, what goes into them and how to assess criteria for achieving <br>
  the results you desire rather than bumbling through the motions.

This poster is part of the continuing effort at Microcosm to create a lasting legacy of who we are and what we do so others can recreate our success from the bread crumbs we leave behind.
