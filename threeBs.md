They are the keys to our awareness, unlocking the doors to our self sovereignty and autonomy.

## Balance


<br>
<br>

## Breaks 
- Take intentional breaks between activities, in relationships, from work etc. <br>
We can ruin the things we either enjoy or must do by over saturating ourselves in them.

Trauma manifests from recieving stimuli, be it negative of positive.
> too much, too fast, too soon, or not enough for too long. 
- Stop filling your time-slots. 
  - We need time between activities to digest / process / integrate information and to down regulate our nervous systems after recieving ample amounts of stimuli.  
> If you must fill out your day, schedule in time to relax / get grounded and focus on other parts of your soul that require expression.
- hobbies
