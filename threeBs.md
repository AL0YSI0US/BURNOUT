# The 3 B's 

> Balance . Breaks . Boundaries

These support our wants, needs and desires. 

They are the keys to our awareness, unlocking the doors to our self sovereignty and autonomy.

## Balance
Consider what it looks like to manage your time, energy and attention across the spectrum of your wants and needs. 
> *What are the things you want to do in order to thrive? and what are the things you need to do in order to survive?*
- Relationships [romantic/platonic/work/family]
- Career / Personal Development
- Hygiene 
- Nutritioun / Diet - *the food we consume*
- Socialozation 
- Political / Activism expression
- Housing
- Healthcare
- Hobbies / Special interests 
- Academic
- Finances
- Excercize / Movement
- *etc.*

<br>

## Breaks 
- Take intentional breaks between activities, in relationships, from work etc. <br>
We can ruin the things we either enjoy or must do by over saturating ourselves in them.

Trauma manifests from recieving stimuli, be it negative of positive.
> too much, too fast, too soon, or not enough for too long. 
- Refrain from scheduling yourself back-to-back anywhere in your day. 👇🏾
  - We need time between activities to digest / process / integrate information and to down regulate our nervous systems after recieving ample amounts of stimuli.  
> If you must fill out your day, schedule in time to relax / get grounded and focus on other parts of your soul that require expression.
- Schedule intentional breaks from everything to ensure spaceousness for needs driven spontenaeity. This could look like carving out a morning / afternoon, taking a day trip or even scheduling multiple day breaks.
- Take breaks from speaking, try to listen more.
- Break often for movement, food, water and rest
