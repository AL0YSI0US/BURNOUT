# The 3 B's 

> Balance . Breaks . Boundaries

These support our wants, needs and desires. 

They are the keys to our awareness, unlocking the doors to our self sovereignty and autonomy. 

We must adopt consent culture within ourselves, this behavior will scale when we relate with one another.

## Balance


<br>
<br>

## Breaks 
- Take intentional breaks between activities, in relationships, from work etc. We can ruin the things we either enjoy or must do by over saturating ourselves in them.
- Stop filling your time-slots. 
  - We need time between activities to digest / process / integrate information and to down regulate our nervous systems after recieving ample amounts of stimuli.  
> If you must fill out your day, schedule in time to relax / get grounded and to focus on other parts of your soul that require expression.
- hobbies
